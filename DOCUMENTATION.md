# FPS Game Development Documentation

## Architecture Overview

This Unreal Engine FPS project follows a component-based architecture with realistic gameplay mechanics inspired by games like Rust and Escape from Tarkov.

### Core Systems

#### Character System (`AFPSCharacter`)
- **Location**: `Source/FPSGame/Characters/`
- **Features**:
  - Physics-based movement with momentum and inertia
  - Realistic stamina system affecting movement speed
  - Multiple movement states: walking, running, crouching, prone
  - Integrated damage and inventory systems

#### Weapon System (`AFPSWeapon`)
- **Location**: `Source/FPSGame/Weapons/`
- **Features**:
  - Realistic ballistics with bullet drop and travel time
  - Advanced recoil patterns and weapon sway
  - Multiple fire modes: single, burst, full-auto
  - Modular attachment system
  - Ammunition management with reload mechanics

#### Damage System (`UDamageComponent`)
- **Location**: `Source/FPSGame/Components/`
- **Features**:
  - Zone-based damage with critical hit detection
  - Armor system with damage reduction
  - Status effects: bleeding, burning, poisoning
  - Health regeneration with delay mechanics

#### Inventory System (`UInventoryComponent`)
- **Location**: `Source/FPSGame/Components/`
- **Features**:
  - Grid-based inventory (Tarkov-style)
  - Weight and space management
  - Item stacking and splitting
  - Quick slots for fast access
  - Data-driven item system

### Key Features

#### Realistic Movement
- **Stamina System**: Running drains stamina, affecting movement capabilities
- **Movement Inertia**: Physics-based acceleration and deceleration
- **Stance System**: Walking, running, crouching, and prone positions
- **Momentum**: Realistic movement physics with proper air control

#### Advanced Ballistics
- **Bullet Physics**: Realistic bullet trajectory with drop over distance
- **Environmental Factors**: Wind effects and gravity simulation
- **Hit Detection**: Precise bone-based hit detection with damage zones
- **Penetration**: Future support for material penetration

#### Weapon Realism
- **Recoil Patterns**: Unique recoil patterns for each weapon type
- **Weapon Sway**: Subtle weapon movement for immersion
- **Fire Modes**: Single, burst, and full-automatic firing
- **Attachments**: Modular weapon customization system

#### Survival Elements
- **Health System**: Realistic health with zone-based damage
- **Status Effects**: Bleeding, burning, and poisoning mechanics
- **Inventory Weight**: Encumbrance affects movement speed
- **Resource Management**: Ammunition and medical supplies

### Configuration Files

#### Input Mapping (`Config/DefaultInput.ini`)
- Movement: WASD keys
- Mouse look with sensitivity settings
- Weapon controls: Mouse buttons, R for reload
- Quick slots: Number keys 1-5
- Stance controls: Shift (run), Ctrl (crouch), Z (prone)

#### Game Settings (`Config/DefaultGame.ini`)
- Project metadata and packaging settings
- Platform-specific configurations

### Building and Running

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Unreal Engine 5.3 or later
   - Visual Studio 2022 (Windows) or compatible C++ compiler

2. **Build Process**:
   ```bash
   # Generate project files
   Right-click FPSGame.uproject → "Generate Visual Studio project files"
   
   # Build using VS Code task
   Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Build Unreal Project"
   ```

3. **Running**:
   - Double-click `FPSGame.uproject` to open in Unreal Editor
   - Press Play in Editor (PIE) to test

### Performance Optimization

#### Object Pooling
- Implement for frequently spawned objects (bullets, effects)
- Reuse objects instead of constant creation/destruction

#### LOD Systems
- Distance-based level-of-detail for complex meshes
- Automatic quality scaling based on distance

#### Physics Optimization
- Simple collision shapes where possible
- Efficient raycasting for line-of-sight checks

#### Memory Management
- Smart pointers for automatic memory management
- Careful management of large assets

### Extending the System

#### Adding New Weapons
1. Create weapon data in the item database
2. Set up weapon stats and recoil patterns
3. Configure attachment points and compatibility
4. Add weapon-specific effects and sounds

#### Custom Components
1. Inherit from `UActorComponent`
2. Implement `TickComponent` for real-time updates
3. Use delegates for event communication
4. Follow Unreal's component best practices

#### New Game Modes
1. Inherit from `AFPSGameMode`
2. Override game rules and win conditions
3. Implement team management and scoring
4. Add mode-specific UI elements

### Debugging and Testing

#### Debug Output
- Use `GEngine->AddOnScreenDebugMessage()` for runtime debugging
- Enable debug drawing for physics and raycasting
- Use Unreal's built-in profiling tools

#### Console Commands
- Access developer console with tilde (~) key
- Useful commands: `stat fps`, `stat memory`, `showdebug physics`

#### Testing Checklist
- Movement feels responsive and realistic
- Weapon recoil patterns are consistent
- Damage zones register hits correctly
- Inventory operations work smoothly
- Performance remains stable under load

### Future Enhancements

#### Planned Features
- Multiplayer networking support
- Advanced AI system for NPCs
- Environmental destruction
- Vehicle system
- Weather and day/night cycles

#### Community Contributions
- Follow coding standards in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Submit pull requests with detailed descriptions
- Include test cases for new features
- Document API changes
