### Component Architecture
The project follows Unreal Engine's component-based architecture:
- **Modular Design**: Each system is self-contained and reusable
- **Interface-Based**: Common interactions through well-defined interfaces
- **Data-Driven**: Configuration through data assets and tables
- **Network-Ready**: All systems designed for multiplayer

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2019/2022 with C++ support
- Windows 10/11 or compatible platform

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd fpsc++
   ```
